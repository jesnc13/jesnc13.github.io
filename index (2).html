        <!--Write some words about yourself in the p tags-->
        <p>I am a senior majoring in Literature and Language: Pre- Law and Professional and Technical Writing. I am considering going to law school in the future, but I would like to explore working for a nonprofit first. I am not tech-savvy at all, and I am pretty worried about keeping up in this class because if I get a few steps behind I feel completely lost. </p>

        <h2>My Project</h2>
        <p>The Suitcase Clinic in Harrisonburg, Virginia provides medical care to the homeless in Harrisonburg City and the surrounding counties. This model allows medical attention to be transportable and readily available to this vulnerable population. The audience for this website will be people living in and around Harrisonburg who want to help ensure the homeless have access to preventative healthcare. Spreading awareness about the effectiveness of the Suitcase Clinic will hopefully result in an increase in donations to the cause that will help supply the many volunteers with medical supplies.</p>
